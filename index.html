                    In April of 2015, Jason Floarea, 29, was sentenced to one year in prison and will have to pay $600,000 in restitution for trafficking stolen and fraudulently obtained phones through his company, Ace Wholesale. Investigators found that in less than two years Floarea’s business, located in suburban Michigan, bought and sold almost <span class="emphasis">400,000</span> stolen phones for more than $151 million. This is the largest federal lawsuit of its kind, but plenty more cell phone trafficking cases are cropping up all over the country. It’s a lucrative business with lighter consequences than other illicit trades.

                    Not all phones being trafficked abroad are stolen through street theft. In fact, the vast majority of the phones that investigators in the Floarea case came across were Apple iPhones that had been purchased fraudulently from mobile providers. This process is called <span class="emphasis">credit muling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="text smallSpacerBot">
                Credit muling involves a “handler” who either bribes or tricks people, often from vulnerable communities, into bulk purchasing contract-subsidized cell phones. The handler then sells the phones to middlemen, like Floarea, who have connections abroad.
  </p>
                <p class="text smallSpacerBot">
                    In the United States phones are subsidized through contracts with carriers on a level not seen in most of the world. Because you can obtain an <span class="emphasis">$800 phone for $200</span> with a service contract, there is a greater incentive to game the system and the payoff can be huge.

            In March, 2013 the California Attorney General charged two individuals with trafficking nearly $4 million in mobile phones to Hong Kong over an 8 month period. Hong Kong, also where the bulk of the phones from Ace Wholesale were sent, is the main international hub for stolen phones, along with Dubai. But it is often not the phone’s final destination. From there, phones are <span class="emphasis">wiped</span> (cleared of data), <span class="emphasis">flashed</span>  (installed with a new operating system), and <span class="emphasis">re-kitted</span>  (boxed with new accessories), and then sent all over the world.

It’s places where the phones will get unlocked, re-flashed, re-kitted. Which means they’ll get put in a new box with new accessories and with a manual, an instruction manual that’s in the language of whatever the destination the country is. Essentially when they are all done they look just like a phone that was intended to be sold in whatever the country is that they are being shipped to. After that we don’t have a lot of visibility ... at that point the damage is done. Once those phones are out the door, we’ve already incurred the losses.<span style="color:#FFCD00; font-size:200%;"><span style="font-family:freight-text-pro;">”</span></span>

                <p class="text">Phones stolen in the United States have been found on every continent except Antarctica. In Latin America smartphones can fetch a much higher price than they can in the US. Import taxes and tariffs can make a legal iPhone cost more than <span class="emphasis">$1000</span> in countries like Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, and Argentina. </p>
                
                <p class="text smallSpacerTop smallSpacerBot">With the legal price of a highly desirable smartphone so high, many people naturally turn to the black market. In many countries, the average worker would have to work for months to be able to afford a legal phone.</p>

                In countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and China, low average wages put an iPhone far out of reach of the average worker. iPhones are in great demand, though, and when the 5s and 6 were released in these countries there were reports of phones being sold on the street for as much as $3,000.

Sticker shock and high demand have resulted in a thriving black market of stolen phones that several Latin American governments are struggling to contain.

                    In an effort to decrease cell phone theft and undercut the black market, California passed a so-called <span class="emphasis">“kill switch”</span> bill last year. Starting on July 1, 2015 phone manufacturers must include security software in all new smartphones sold in the state. The kill switch will allow owners to remotely disable a stolen phone and render its software inoperable - at least in the United States. 
                    
                    <p class="text smallSpacerTop smallSpacerBot">One of the original proponents of the kill switch legislation was San Francisco District Attorney, George Gascon. </p>

                <p class="text">Minnesota passed a similar kill switch law in 2014, and eight other states have begun the legislative process to follow suit. Two bills currently in front of Congress could make the kill switch a federal mandate.</p>
                <p class="text smallSpacerTop">
                    In 2013, Apple added the “activation lock” feature, which is essentially their version of this kill-switch. iPhone thefts in San Francisco dropped 38 percent since Apple introduced this security feature. In the same amount of time, the theft of Samsung phones - which don’t yet have this kind of software - increased by 12 percent.</p>
                <p class="text smallSpacerTop">
                    Gascon says the point of implementing the kill switch is to eliminate the incentive for stealing phones in the first place. Deactivated, a stolen cell phone is less likely hold its black market value. </p>
                <p class="text smallSpacerTop">
                    For manufacturers and wireless carriers, this is a bittersweet deal because cell phone insurance is a billion dollar industry. A report from 2013 found that the top four wireless carriers in the U.S. brought in almost $8 billion dollars just from protection plans and top electronics retailers received another $4.3 billion in new insurance contracts. </p>
                <p class="text smallSpacerTop">
                    While many experts and anti-cell phone theft organizations celebrate kill switch laws as a step in the right direction, some worry the technology alone is not comprehensive enough to eliminate the issue altogether.</p>
